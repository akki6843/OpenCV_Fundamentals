# OpenCV_Fundamentals  
This repository is a development work done while following a Udemy course on OpenCV available at below mentioned link 
Idea behind this repo is to revise traditional OpenCV methods using different projects.

## Project 1 : Hide message in a Image :-
    This project helps in with following exercises :
        - read, write and display images.
        - using of ord, chr functions in python.
        - opencv to manipulate images such as color image to gray images.
        - Image slicing.

## Project 2 : Time Lapsed in a Video :-
    In this project we will learn the following topics :
        - Read a stored videofile
        - Display video as a stream of images.
        - Performing video manipulation on a frame by frame basis.
        - Reading a video directly from a webcam

## Project 3 : Counting number of candies on a desk :  
    In this project we will learn the following topics : 
        - Grey color images.
        - Binary Images.
        - Applying filters such as Gaussian filter.
        - Image threshold-ing.
        - Edge Detection.
        - Image Counter Detection

## Project 4 :  Counting Candies in a Video :
    This is a extension of Project 3 where we learned, how to process a image.
    In this project the same Idea has been repurposed to find candies in the real time video.

## Project 5 : Finding the Queen in Carrom Board :  
    This project will teach us the following topics : 
        - Revision of contours 
        - Color Threshold-ing 
        - LAB Color Schema
        - InRange function for binary images

## Project 6 : Are you wearing company T-Shirt :
    Topics covered in this lessons are :
        - Color Schemes 
        - Color Thresholding using Inrange and masks 
        - Otsu Thresholding method
        - Morphological Opreations (EROSION and DILATION)
        - Contour Analysis 
        - Histographs 

## Project 7 : Real World Problem :
